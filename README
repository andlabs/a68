This isn't goinstallable ("go get-able"?) yet, and in fact won't do anything right now but dump some debugging stuff or whine about unimplemented opcodes. But it builds and parses a test file correctly, apparently! I need to analyze yacc's output as well...

The goal is simple: be a MC68000 assembler that doesn't suck. It'll probably be the first assembler period that doesn't enforce whitespace restrictions; instead, statements are delimited by :: (inserted by the lexer at the end of a line). It will have a somewhat different macro syntax to other assemblers. It requires opcode suffixes except in few situations. It assembles in a single pass. Temporary labels + and - are provided, but are local instead of global.

Suggestions are welcome.
